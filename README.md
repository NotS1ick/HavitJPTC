This is a project for a JPTC 2024 challenge.

Hopefully you can understand the code (because I can't understand it anymore).

<h1><b>How To Run It:<b/></h1>

1. Download the release.
2. After downloading extract the zip file.
3. Open a command prompt or an code editor with a terminal.
4. Do the command to cd in the Havit folder, for example "cd C:\Users\....\Downloads\HavitJPTC-Release\HavitJPTC-Release\Havit"
5. Run the command: dotnet run (or you can run: "dotnet watch")
6. Now just go to a browser of your preferance and go to: http://localhost:5000
7. Now enjoy the app
